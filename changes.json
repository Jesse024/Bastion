  "KILLED THESE BUGS": [
    "The *Server Configuration* module grew so much that it crossed Discord's message limit and apparently broke the commands list. So, we broke the *Server Configuration* module and introduced the *Filters* module - a kick off of all filtering commands from *Server Configuration* module.",
    "Fixed an issue with the `reputation` command that gave karma to yourself!"
  ]
